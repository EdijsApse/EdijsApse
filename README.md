# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Edijs. Self-Taught Software Developer

Other people describe me as a friendly, helpful, and hardworking person. One of my passions is hockey, which I played as a kid, but I'm mostly a big fan now.

Besides that, I enjoy watching movies, taking walks, and simply listening to music. My biggest passion is web development, which I started learning in my early 20s.

## ðŸš€ About My Journey In WEB Development

Web Development is something I started after college graduation. I began with Front-End languages, including HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and later the jQuery library. After writing a few hundred lines of code and a few scripts, I realized that I enjoyed coding and wanted to make it my career. To expand my knowledge, I took two web development courses, which provided a solid foundation, but I felt the need to learn more.

I achieved this by enrolling in additional online courses, mainly through the Udemy platform. After a few months of self-study, I secured my first job in IT as a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer. Since then, I've worked in a couple of startups, gaining a few years of experience. However, I believe this is just the beginning of my journey.
